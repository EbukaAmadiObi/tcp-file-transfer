The aim of this project is to write software to transfer a file from one computer to another, over the Internet.
It uses one of the Internet standard transport-layer protocols, TCP (transmission control protocol).  This protocol, and all the lower-level protocols that you need, were provided to us.
Our work was in designing the application layer protocol, and then implementing our design by writing software in C, which interfaces to TCP using the functions provided.

See [TCP_Report.pdf](https://github.com/EbukaAmadiObi/tcp-file-transfer/blob/main/TCP_Report.pdf) for a more in-depth description of the methods used
*This project was completed in collaboration with another student, as part of EEEN20060-Communication Systems, University College Dublin.*
